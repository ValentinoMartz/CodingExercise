# Coding Exercise

    Hello SnapWrite AI team!

This is my resolution for your proposal, everything was done with JS, React, and Tailwind.

I think I was able to complete it in its entirety, with the particularity that maybe I didn't respect 100% the proportions just to allow the elements to be responsive and flow with each other.

Beyond this, inside the code there are some more comments about the logic, but I think that even without reading them you can interpret how I did it.

Thank you very much for this opportunity, it was really nice since I learned and refreshed some knowledge.

Although you have my email, I attach my portfolio in case you want to know more about me üòÅ:
